This project was built using javascript, HTML5, and CSS.

I began with the game authorisation which was based on a template made during training. I then worked out the game logic using pen and paper and playing the game, determining the win coditions through good old fashioned elbow grease. I then modelled the win conditions out in javascript.

I proceeded to build the game board in HTML and then styled it on CSS. After which, I wrote out the event handlers and linked it to the game board through lots of trial and error. I tested it at various steps and hit lots of roadblocks when my code broke. I went back and re-did what I had made. At this point I had gotten the game to be played but it did not connect with the api, i.e. the player could not retrieve games. After more trial and error, and generous use of console logs to see which parts of my code was breaking, I managed to get them to link, leading to a playable MVP game.
